# Physics-Informed_Neural_Networks

A selection of Physics-informed Neural Networks that solve the heat equation, a 2D Navier-Stokes flow around a cylinder problem, and the concentration values of a 3D Navier-Stokes flow around a brain aneurysm.

All code is based on codes from McClenny and Raissi's githubs: <br />
